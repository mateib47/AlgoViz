            <h1>Bubble Sort</h1>
            <p>Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort,
                is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps
                through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps
                them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through
                the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm,
                which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger
                elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
function bubbleSort(length){
    let sorted = false;
    while(!sorted){
        sorted = true;
        for(let i = 0;i< length-1;i++){
            let a = document.querySelector('#bar-'+i);
            let b = document.querySelector('#bar-'+`${i+1}`)
            if((parseFloat(a.style.maxHeight) / 100.0)>(parseFloat(b.style.maxHeight) / 100.0)){
                sorted = false
                let temp = a.style.maxHeight;
                a.style.maxHeight = b.style.maxHeight;
                b.style.maxHeight = temp;
            }

        <h1>Merge Sort</h1>
        <p>Merge sort is an efficient, general-purpose, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most
            implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the order of equal elements is the
            same in the input and output. Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented
            by John von Neumann in 1945. A detailed description and analysis of bottom-up merge sort
            appeared in a report by Goldstine and von Neumann as early as 1948.</p>
        <p>Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted).</li>
            <li>Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.</li>
        </ol>
        <pre><code>function mergeSort(array) {
  const half = array.length / 2;
  if(array.length < 2){
    return array
  }
  const left = array.splice(0, half);
  return merge(mergeSort(left),mergeSort(array));
}
function merge(left, right) {
    let arr = []
    while (left.length && right.length) {
        if (left[0] < right[0]) {
            arr.push(left.shift())
        } else {
            arr.push(right.shift())
        }
    }
    return [ ...arr, ...left, ...right ]
}
        </code></pre>

        <h1>Quick Sort</h1>
        <p>Quicksort is a type of divide and conquer algorithm
            for sorting an array, based on a partitioning routine. The
            details of this partitioning can vary somewhat, so that quicksort
            is really a family of closely related algorithms.</p>
        <p>The steps for in-place quicksort are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If the range has less than two elements, return immediately
                as there is nothing to do. Possibly for other very short lengths
                a special-purpose sorting method is applied and the remainder of these steps skipped.</li>
            <li>Otherwise pick a value, called a pivot, that occurs in the range</li>
            <li>Partition the range: reorder its elements, while determining a point of division,
                so that all elements with values less than the pivot come before the division,
                while all elements with values greater than the pivot come after it; elements that are
                equal to the pivot can go either way</li>
            <li>Recursively apply the quicksort to the sub-range up to the point of division and
                to the sub-range after it, possibly excluding from both ranges the element equal
                to the pivot at the point of division</li>
        </ol>
        <pre><code>function quickSort(array){
    if (array.length <= 1) {
        return array;
    }
    const pivot = array[0];
    let left = [], right = [];
    for(let i=1;i < array.length;i++){
        array[i] < pivot ?
            left.push(array[i]) : right.push(array[i]);
    }
    return quickSort(left).concat(pivot, quickSort(right));
}
        </code></pre>
        <p class="italic">The average and best-case time complexity for quicksort(simple partition) is <b>O(n log(n))</b>. The worst-case performance is <b>O(n^2)</b>.</p>
